# py_dsa

A repository for learning and implementing data structures and algorithms (DSA) in Python. The goal is to deepen understanding of DSA concepts by writing the algorithms from scratch, testing their correctness with `pytest` unit tests, and providing usage examples.

## Features

- **Algorithms:** Implementations of classic algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming).
- **Data Structures:** Code for common data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs).
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive tests for each implementation using `pytest` to ensure correctness.
- **Examples:** Example scripts demonstrating usage and performance of the algorithms.
